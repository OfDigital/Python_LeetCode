# You have a 2-D grid of size m x n representing a box, 
# and you have n balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.

# Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell 
# that can redirect a ball to the right or to the left.

# A board that redirects the ball to the right spans the top-left corner to 
# the bottom-right corner and is represented in the grid as 1.
# A board that redirects the ball to the left spans the top-right corner to 
# the bottom-left corner and is represented in the grid as -1.
# We drop one ball at the top of each column of the box. 
# Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. 
# A ball gets stuck if it hits a "V" shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects 
# the ball into either wall of the box.

# Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the column that 
# the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from 
# the ith column at the top, or -1 if the ball gets stuck in the box.

# Example 1:
# Input: grid = [[1,1,1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
# Output: [1,-1,-1,-1,-1]

# Example 2:
# Input: grid = [[-1]]
# Output: [-1]

# Example 3:
# Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
# Output: [0,1,2,3,4,-1]
